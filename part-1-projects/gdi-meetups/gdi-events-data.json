In this class, we'll focus on how you can research and interview potential users, and create a product that is direct and meaningful to your audience.</p> <p>Before you can create a product, you must clarify who your users are and what they need. With user research, you and your team will be able discover what your target audience desires and expects from you -- so you can build a successful product for your customers.</p> <p>User research will also be able to provide data for any design decisions made throughout the project, hereby helping you tackle the “If I were the user…” comment from others on your project team because we are not our users.</p> <p>This class is for anyone who is interested in exploring user research techniques and diving deeper into the user experience design process. All technology specialties are welcome.</p> <p>In this course we will cover:</p> <p>• What user research is and why it is important and valuable</p> <p>Provide an overview of other UX research methods</p> <p>• How is user research different from usability testing</p> <p>• How to plan and conduct a research study</p> <p>• Types of user research techniques, focusing primarily on interviewing</p> <p>• How to write interview questions</p> <p>• How to fit user research into your process</p> <p>• Getting buy-in from your colleagues and clients</p> <p>• How to communicate research findings and make them actionable</p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <p>We recommend Intro to User Experience (UX) as a prerequisite to this course. Otherwise a baseline understanding of user experience (UX) principles is recommended, but not required.</p> <p>About the teacher:</p> <p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/6/f/600_458710095.jpeg" /></p> <p>Amy Quinn is a builder and investigator by nature, and considers herself fortunate to have found a way to exercise these strengths as a UX leader, strategist, and researcher.
